Original print was sliced in [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer) and printed on a Creality Ender 3 Pro, using add:north e-PLA. I had to shrink the computer a tiny tiny amount, to make it fit better, but your mileage may vary.

Text is recommended to print on its back, and the model i prepared to be printed as two parts, that can be glued together.
The "computer fixed" model is modified from the original, by removing the hangover between computer and monitor, to remove print issues.
